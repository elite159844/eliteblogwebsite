## Important Things To Know:

Spending money on game offers can help speed up progress and make it easier to complete but the main thing to these game offers is knowledge and strategies. 

If its your first time doing one, its recommended to reach out to people who might've done this offer before. you can also find guides on reddit, discord, etc.

# Minimize Tracking Issues 

Game Offers will require you to allow tracking in the app, so make sure you do that, or else the offer won't track your progress. When you click on a game offer and it redirects you to the app store its recommended that you stay in the app store and open the game from there.

Losing internet connection while a game is downloading can cause tracking issues. Some things that you should also note is that losing internet connection while your in the middle of doing a game offer will not cause tracking issues.
